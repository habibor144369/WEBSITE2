                 For all the times that you rain on my parade
                And all the clubs you get in using my name
                You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
                You think I'm crying, on my own well I ain't
                And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still    care
                I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
                I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
                My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
                And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
                But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
                                
                [Verse 1]
                For all the times that you rained on my parade
                And all the clubs you get in using my name
                You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake

                [Refrain]
                And I didn't wanna write a song

                I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                And baby I'll be movin' on
                And I think you should be somethin'
                I don't wanna hold back
                Maybe you should know that

                [Pre-Chorus]
                My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
                And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on

                [Chorus]
                'Cause if you like the way you look that much
                Oh baby you should go and love yourself
                And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
                You should go and love yourself

                [Verse 2]
                But when you told me that you hated my friends
                The only problem was with you and not them
                And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
                And tried to make me forget where I came from

                [Refrain]
                And I didn't wanna write a song
                'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

                And baby I'll be movin' on
                And I think you should be somethin'
                I don't wanna hold back

                You should go and love yourself

                [Bridge]
                For all the times that you made me feel small
                I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
                I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
                Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

                [Chorus]
                'Cause if you like the way you look that much
                Oh baby you should go and love yourself
                And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
                You should go and love yourself
                'Cause if you like the way you look that much
                Oh baby you should go and love yourself
                And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
                You should go and love yourself

                        And all the clubs you get in using my name
                        You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
                        You think I'm crying, on my own well I ain't
                        And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still    care
                        I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                        And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
                        I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
                        My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
                        And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                        And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
                        But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
                                        
                        [Verse 1]
                        For all the times that you rained on my parade
                        And all the clubs you get in using my name
                        You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
                        You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't
        
                        [Refrain]
                        And I didn't wanna write a song
                        'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
                        I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                        And baby I'll be movin' on
                        And I think you should be somethin'
                        I don't wanna hold back
                        Maybe you should know that
        
                        [Pre-Chorus]
                        My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
                        And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                        And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
                        But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
        
                        [Chorus]
                        'Cause if you like the way you look that much
                        Oh baby you should go and love yourself
                        And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
                        You should go and love yourself
        
                        [Verse 2]
                        But when you told me that you hated my friends
                        The only problem was with you and not them
                        And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
                        And tried to make me forget where I came from
        
                        [Refrain]
                        And I didn't wanna write a song
                        'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
                        I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                        And baby I'll be movin' on
                        And I think you should be somethin'
                        I don't wanna hold back
                        Maybe you should know that
        
                        [Pre-Chorus]
                        My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
                        And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                        And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
                        But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
        
                        [Chorus]
                        'Cause if you like the way you look that much
                        Oh baby you should go and love yourself
                        And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
                        You should go and love yourself
        
                        [Bridge]
                        For all the times that you made me feel small
                        I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
                        I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
                        Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
        
                        [Chorus]
                        'Cause if you like the way you look that much
                        Oh baby you should go and love yourself
                        And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
                        You should go and love yourself
                        'Cause if you like the way you look that much
                        Oh baby you should go and love yourself
                        And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
                        You should go and love yourself
